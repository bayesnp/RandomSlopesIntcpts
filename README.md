# RandomSlopesIntcpts
This repository shows you how to fit a random intercepts, random slopes model using R.  The model equation is found in the 'model_eqn.pdf' file.

## Step 1

Download and run the 'gen_simulated_data.R' to generate a workable dataset.

## Step 2

Run the 'fit_model.R' to fit the model.  This may require installing the rstanarm package.
